# DIcEd - Desktop Icon Editor for the Apple IIgs

Written in TML Pascal.

This source is a tad later than anything I released. There were two changes in progress:

(1) I was considering speeding up the fatbits drawing routine in Guts.pas, by replacing the part marked "slow.fatbits" with something else, either based on CopyPixels (expanding a pixel map), or just based on caching the pixel image.

(2) I was experimenting with a periwinkle blue background behind the "sample icons" instead of a white background.
